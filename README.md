# 📱 **React Native App - Assignment03 (IT3133-P)-Student Care App**  

This project demonstrates my learning experience with React Native by implementing navigation features such as **Stack Navigation** and **Bottom Navigation**.  
## **📖 Overview**  
This app showcases:  
- **Stack Navigation**: Managing navigation between screens with a stack-based approach.  
- **Bottom Navigation**: Providing an easy-to-access menu for core app features using a bottom navigation bar.  
## **✨ Features**  
- **Stack Navigation**: Navigate between screens seamlessly while maintaining a screen history.  
- **Bottom Navigation**: Switch between key app sections using a tab-based navigation bar.
